### Implementation Procedures:
1. Set up the projection matrix, prepare three model matrix in the js file and apply them on the vertices of the cube. 
2. Adjust the position of three cubes by model matrix. Now the red one, the green one and the blue one respectively are in one-point, two-point, three-point perspective.

### Part3 Reflection
List the transformation matrices that you used in Parts 1 and 2 
>  $T=VM$ and $T = PVM$

For each cube, write down a formula showing how the matrices were concatenated to become the current transformation matrix (CTM) that was used to transform the vertices in the vertex shader.
> $T=PVM = PVT' B_R B_S$ , among them $T'$ is the translation matrix, $B_R $ and $B_S$ are the rotation and scaling matrices. Check the code snippets for specific parameters for different cubes.

### Relevant Code Snippets
```js
// different rotation, translation matrix for different cubes
M  = transform(0, [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);
M1 = transform(45, [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);
M2 = transform(45, [0.5, -1, 1.1], [1, 1, 1], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]);

for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
	vertices.push(mult(M1, vertices[i]));
}
for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
	vertices.push(mult(M2, vertices[i]));
}
for (let i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
	vertices[i] = mult(M, vertices[i]);
}
